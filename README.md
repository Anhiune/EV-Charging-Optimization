# EV-Charging-Optimization
To optimize electric vehicle charging station locations to reduce operational costs while maintaining citywide accessibility
### **Project Overview**

This project focuses on enhancing the efficiency and equity of electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure deployment in the Twin Cities area. Using a combination of spatial modeling, economic analysis, and policy simulation, I proposed an optimized charging station layout that maximizes coverage while minimizing costsâ€”particularly in underserved, low-income neighborhoods.

### **Research Highlights**

- Used **R, Stata, and Excel** to conduct **spatial analysis** on traffic patterns, existing station placement, and public electricity infrastructure.
- Modeled **area-specific electricity rates and demand elasticity** to forecast utilization and cost-effectiveness across multiple scenarios.
- Developed **cost-structure simulations** to identify ideal pricing strategies and investment return windows.
- Presented findings to **20+ local government and city planning officers**, translating technical results into **accessible, actionable insights** to support real-world policy implementation.
- The proposal supported **low-income neighborhood infrastructure expansion**, with real consideration from city officials for pilot implementation.
